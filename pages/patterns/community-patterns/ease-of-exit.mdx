# Ease of Exit

The ways in which members can leave decentralized organizations should be as clear as ways in which they can join.

For decentralized organizations that rely on member contributions, they should ensure their departing members can easily access the treasury, through the ability to claim the treasury's funds in proportion to their contributions.

This is especially important for decentralized organizations that emerge in relation to a time-bounded goal, such as speedrun DAOs bidding on an auction, enabling members to reclaim their contributions in case the decentralized organization does not reach its goal.
