# Reduce Voter Apathy with Shielded Voting

## Problem

Whales and large holders of DAO governance tokens can influence voting by voting early or late, creating an environment where no one votes because they expect their influence to be minimal. If you see your option winning strongly, it may not be worth your time to vote, and if you see your option losing strongly, you might think why would you waste your time trying to help it.

## Solution

Enable shielded voting with threshold encryption. Shielded voting can enable a DAO to hide how the vote is progressing until the proposal reaches its end. The vote will be transparent afterward, but along the way this can reduce the chance for voter apathy and maximize turnout.
