# Multi-Decision-Making

## Problem

Decision-making framework is ill-suited for an organization's diverse needs. Some proposals call for nuanced discussion, while others impact only a small segment of members.

## Solution

Implement multiple decision-making patterns, taking into account the different stakeholders, attention levels, and governance that may be required.

## Tools
