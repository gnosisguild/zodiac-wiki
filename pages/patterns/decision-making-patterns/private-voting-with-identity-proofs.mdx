# Private Voting with Identity Proofs

## Problem

DAO ecosystem contributors and voters are coming under increasing scrutiny from regulatory bodies for their participation in community-governed protocols and wallets. In addition, tying voting actions and preferences to identity via wallets can reveal transnational activity, reducing privacy.

## Solution

Identity proofs can help DAO contributors attest to their identity one time for entry into the DAO, but never reveal their entire on-chain data trail within the DAO afterward. Enable 1-human 1-vote private voting within the DAO, use the identity proofs to read the data trail of activity, but not reveal identities so that reputation can be accounted for.
