# Decision Authorities

## Problem

Not clear who makes decisions, therefore teams run into stumbling blocks during execution and canâ€™t deliver.

## Solution

One possible solution is adopting the RAID model or co-designing a model like it.

Recommend (R) - authority to recommend/propose a particular decision
Align / Approve (A) - authority to effectively veto a decision
Input (I) - authority to provide input on a decision
Decide (D) - authority to authorize the decision

Work with other stewards to introduce the model with each working group. Trial it for 2 months and re-evaluate.
