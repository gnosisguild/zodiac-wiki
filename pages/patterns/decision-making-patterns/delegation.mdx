# Delegation

## Problem

DAO operatives are unclear on how a decision is made, and thus seek out a steward for every little decision. This dramatically slows down the DAO's ability to ship.

## Solution

Define clear areas of decision-making scope with working groups, and help working group members and leads ask and answer - “are you asking for an opinion or for permission?”

Within the scope, if it is permission, there’s no need to ask.
