# Temporal Scoping

There are times to build and times to reap. Determining when, how often, and for how long can provide the temporal scoping necessary to better support build cycles and manage expectations across different (and sometimes multiple) timeframes.

Some questions to consider:

- How long will the project take to complete? (temporal expectations)
- How much time is needed to determine what success is? (time evaluations)
- When and how often should benefits be reaped? (harvest rhythms)
