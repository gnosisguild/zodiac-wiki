# Digital Garden

A digital garden is an online space where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. In a DAO, people work together to make sense of things. This is like a digital community garden where everyone can share their ideas and help make the garden grow healthy.

In this regard, digital gardens can be seen as an ideal metaphor for DAOs to document their processes and decision-making in a collaborative, participatory way. By engaging the community in documenting DAO activities and initiatives using digital garden tools and templates, DAOs can tap into their members' collective wisdom, allowing for more effective sensemaking and decision-making.

With everyone working together, DAOs can thrive and grow into beautiful, productive entities.
