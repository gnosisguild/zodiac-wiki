# Exit Standards

## Problem

Standards of behavior for DAO stewards are not captured anywhere, and itâ€™s hard to kick people out for not representing values or threatening the health of the DAO if there isn't a roughly agreed upon standard for acceptable behavior. Making these up as you go is a recipe for disaster.

## Solution

Establish clear guidelines for behavior for stewards, make it easy for anyone to call a steward vote to oust people who are not concordant with these guidelines, and define the standards by which they can be invoked.

Consider signaling proposals before actually invoking expulsion.
