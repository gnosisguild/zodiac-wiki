# Metablogging

A metablog is an informal internal blog of an organization written by its members. The pattern, initiated by [Metalabel](https://gnosisguild.github.io/zodiac-wiki/index.php/Metalabels.html), creates space for members to ["detail what they're working on and thinking about."](https://ideaspace.substack.com/p/metablogging) Commenting and asking questions on each other's blog posts are critical components of the metablogging practice, underscoring the benefits of asynchronous communication, post-permission collaboration, and open information.

Key benefits of metablogging:

- transparency around decisions, ideas, and plans
- a chronological record of past thinking
- less meetings

While organizations decide what cadence and approach work best for them, regular rhythms and thoughts-in-progress are generally valued over polished works.
