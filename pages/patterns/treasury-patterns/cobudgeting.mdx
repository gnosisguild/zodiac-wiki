# Cobudgeting

## Problem

It is unclear how to utilize the DAOs funds or set a budget, and many DAOs just wait for a leader or boss to set one, as they come from hierarchical organizations where this is the norm.

It also puts a lot of pressure on leaders to make all the budget decisions, from $X up to $XXX,XXX, when that may not be necessary below some defined threshold.

## Solution

Cobudgeting - enable DAO members to propose projects, and weight their input based on who is directly contributing to the project + leadership, and hold group discussions, either live or in forums, to introduce the proposals. Start small. 10k or less, and scale up as you learn.
