# Holding in Common

## Problem

A DAO has to trust an exceedingly busy and distant core team to execute multisig proposals.

## Solution

Expand the multisig to a treasury accessible by the community.

## Example

- [Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/QmNMRBnipvRfos9ze1MrKpFAsHqxhNrmxjrXzxJnhFif9b)
