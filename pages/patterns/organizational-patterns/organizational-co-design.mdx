# Organizational Co-Design

## Problem

Not clear who owns what in an organization, and who delivers what, and as a consequence, initiatives drag on with no clear delivery date or ownership.

## Solution

Organizations deliver their org chart, and everyone is used to fiat hierarchies.

Instead, co-design reporting lines with stewards, working group leads, and iterate on them multiple times per year. Make sure that reporting don't entail authority, but ownership.
