# Manifesto

DAOs bring people together to organize for a purpose. As the group grows, or that purpose becomes ambitious, it can be helpful to clarify exactly *why* the group is formed. A manifesto attempts to capture the spirit, philosophy, and principles of the movement.

A good manifesto is light on prescriptive processes & rules and heavy on principles & philosophy. Focus more on "why" than "how"

## Uses

When there is conflict or things get confusing, the manifesto can become a point of reference to remind the group why they are working together.

Referring to the manifesto and grounding decisions on it can grant weight or authority to what might otherwise be "just another opinion."

TLDR: Have a founding document about "Why" you're working together.
