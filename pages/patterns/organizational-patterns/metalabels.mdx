# Metalabels

Metalabels are release clubs where groups of people who share the same interests collaborate to drop and support work together. A metalabel is an organizational container wherein individuals join under a common identity to release distinct public works that reflect and manifest their views.

The metalabel organizational container is an example of creativity in multiplayer mode. This can include people pooling skills, audiences, and resources in support of a larger creative vision.
