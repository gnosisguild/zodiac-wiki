# Pods, Guilds, and Squads

DAOs can assemble smaller member groups to tackle discrete tasks and solve issues. Common names for such teams include pods, guilds, squads, and working groups.

These groups can be granted a level of autonomy and even their own budget to move projects forward without being hindered by process or hierarchy, which ultimately feeds back into the DAO's overarching objectives. This creates both expectations for accountability and a dynamic ownership of tasks. By focusing on specific workstreams or clusters of duties, these teams can also serve modular purposes, including the flexibility to decouple from larger member structures and collaborate more fluidly across the DAO ecosystem.
