        <p>zodiac.wiki is an open, living resource for DAOs. It is home to a shared library of reading materials, documentation, stories, and a pattern language describing common problems and offering practical responses for organizations. While DAOs collectively steward the resource and take responsibility for its maintenance, anyone is able to create an account and contribute.</p>
