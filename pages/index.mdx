# Zodiac Wiki

![Zodiac.wiki](/Zodiac-story-library.jpg)

Zodiac Wiki is an open, living resource for DAOs and other onchain entities. It is home to a shared library of reading materials, documentation, stories, and a pattern language for onchain organizations. While DAOs collectively steward the resource and take responsibility for its maintenance, anyone is able to contribute.

## Documentation

Zodiac is a collection of tools for onchain entities, built according to an [open standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5005). The standard enables DAOs and other onchain organizations to act more like constellations, connecting protocols, platforms, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.

## Patterns

The patterns on Zodiac Wiki describe common problems and offers practical responses for organizations. By co-developing and co-organizing a pattern language together, deeper insights will be revealed. [View all patterns](/patterns)

## Library

The Library features a collectively curated selection of texts related to decentralized governance. Ranging from books to hyperlinks, the library items are considered by the Zodiac ecosystem to be rich, informative, or historically important. [View the library](/library)

## Stories

The Stories section is an archive of inactive, failed, and otherwise deceased crypto projects with lessons worth remembering. The lessons distilled here may later be shaped into patterns. [View all stories](/stories)
