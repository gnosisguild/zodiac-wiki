# Exit Pattern

![Exit Pattern Banner](/Banner-exit.jpg)

## Description

The Zodiac Exit pattern allows members to redeem a designated token for a proportion of an avatar's (a Safe or other web3 account's) digital assets. To incorporate this pattern, a DAO can equip the Exit Module to its Safe and members can visit the [Exit App](https://exit.gnosisguild.org/) when they choose to exit. [Read more about the Exit App](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/6CnO4NQYqpF_gPTj3XWJeSmXG3InaTSg-MpgNtaHE0s).

## Core Benefits

- Enables members to redeem tokens (ERC-20 and ERC-721) for a proportion of the DAO's digital assets
- Allows for redemptions that are trustless and permissionless
- Empowers DAO members to easily exit organizations for any reason

## Example Use Case

A speedrun DAO formed to crowdfund for an auction, but the bid was unsuccessful. Because the DAO equipped its Gnosis Safe with the Exit Module, members can use the standalone [App](https://exit.gnosisguild.org) to instantly and permissionlessly redeem the DAO's governance token for a proportion of its designated treasury asset, such as ETH or DAI.
