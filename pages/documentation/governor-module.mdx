## Description

Zodiac Governor Module enables an [OpenZeppelin Governor](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/) contract as a Safe module. By equipping the most popular onchain governance framework as a module, a multisig can seamlessly transition into a multiplayer DAO with onchain voting, while still maintaining flexibility and optionality.

## Core Benefits

- Enables a seamless transition from multisig to DAO with onchain voting
- Can be used in parallel with other modules for advanced functionality
- Allows a DAO to avoid future switching costs

## Example Use Case

A group of friends share a multisig that grows beyond expectations. They decide to upgrade the multisig to a multiplayer DAO by equipping the Zodiac Governor Module. By tapping into the most popular onchain governance framework, the squad can immediately enjoy onchain voting. Down the line, they can decide to keep things open and modular or, for example, use the full capabilities of the [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) platform.
