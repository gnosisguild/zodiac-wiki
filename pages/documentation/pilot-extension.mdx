## Description

Zodiac Pilot is a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zodiac-pilot/jklckajipokenkbbodifahogmidkekcb?hl=en&authuser=0) that enables users to simulate, record, and batch dapp transactions on behalf of a DAO. By using the Pilot extension, owners of a Safe (avatar) or any address designated in a mod like the [Roles Modifier](/documentation/roles-modifier) can verify dapp interactions before submitting them as a multi-send batch transaction for gas savings and easy signing.

## Core Benefits

- Batch multiple transactions together to save on gas
- Simulate every transaction with [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/transaction-simulator) to ensure accuracy
- Submit transactions directly to the Safe for easy signing

## Example Use Case

A DAO wants to implement a DeFi strategy to generate yield, but the Safe owners are not experts in treasury management. By specifying role-based permissions for a specific address using the [Roles Modifier](/documentation/roles-modifier), the DAO can hire a third-party treasury manager to use Zodiac Pilot to simulate and batch DeFi transactions on its behalf, all in a non-custodial, transparent, and trust-minimized way.
