# Zodiac Pilot

## Description

Zodiac Pilot is a browser-based tool for Safe accounts that enables users to build and execute multi-step transactions across multiple dapps. It combines modular batching, [programmable permissions](/documentation/roles-modifier), and a built-in sandbox environment to simulate transactions before theyâ€™re sent onchain. Designed to streamline treasury, governance, and DeFi workflows, Pilot reduces risk and coordination overhead by letting users manage execution directly from a side panel interface. [Add Pilot to your browser](https://pilot.gnosisguild.org)

## Overview

Pilot simplifies Safe-based operations by combining simulation, batching, and permissioned execution in one seamless interface. Whether you're coordinating treasury actions, managing DeFi strategies, or handling governance operations, Pilot reduces complexity and increases flexibility and control. Designed for both individual signers and role-based operators, it enables faster, safer, and more programmable onchain execution.

## Core Benefits

- Save gas by batching multi-step interactions across dapps
- Reduce signer fatigue and minimize manual coordination
- Delegate execution with fine-grained, programmable roles using [Zodiac Roles](/documentation/roles-modifier)
- Simulate transaction flows before submitting them onchain
- Execute from a browser-native side panel without leaving your workflow

## Key Features

- **Multi-Dapp Batching:** Bundle multiple onchain actions into a single transaction to reduce cost and complexity
- **Simulation Forks:** Run transactions in a dedicated testing environment before committing onchain
- **Programmable Permissions:** Use [Zodiac Roles](/documentation/roles-modifier) to define exactly which actions can be taken, by whom, and under what conditions
- **Routing Tools:** Automatically surface viable execution paths between accounts for more efficient coordination
- **Multi-Account Management:** View balances, switch between Safe accounts, and transfer assets in one interface

## Example Use Cases

- An onchain entity delegates LP and swap permissions to a treasury operator, who batches and simulates actions before submitting them to the Safe
- A contributor executes votes, token transfers, and proposal updates as a single batched transaction
- A DeFi strategist simulates complex cross-protocol interactions before sending them onchain
- A multisig team automates recurring payments using reusable execution routes
