# Zodiac Pilot Operator Tutorial

### About Zodiac Pilot

Zodiac Pilot is a browser-based tool for Safe accounts that lets owners and trusted delegates build and execute multi-step transactions across multiple dapps. It combines modular batching, [programmable permissions](/documentation/roles-modifier), and a built-in sandbox environment to simulate transactions before they’re sent onchain. 

Designed to streamline treasury, governance, and DeFi workflows, Pilot reduces risk and coordination overhead by letting users manage execution directly from a side panel interface. [[Learn more]](/documentation/pilot-extension)

### Terminology

- **Pilot Signer**: the EOA wallet that creates and signs transactions.
- **Safe Account**: the smart contract account being acted on.
- **Route**: a configured account path that defines how a Pilot Signer can interact with a Safe Account.
- **Batch:** a bundle of transactions created in Pilot’s side panel and submitted together for execution.

## 01 Get Started

### Install the Pilot Extension

1. Go to [pilot.gnosisguild.org](http://pilot.gnosisguild.org/)
2. Using a Chromium-based browser (Google Chrome, Brave, Opera, Edge), add the Pilot extension.
3. Pin the extension to your browser toolbar for easy access.

### Connect Signer Wallet

Before creating a route (which defines the Pilot Signer and the Safe Account it will act on), you’ll need to connect a signer wallet.

1. Open the Pilot side panel by clicking the Chrome extension button in your browser toolbar.
2. Click **+Add route** — this will open Pilot’s companion app. 
3. In the companion app, click **Connect Pilot Signer** and choose the EOA you’ll use to sign transactions and/or set up account routes.
    
*Note: If the companion app has limited functionality, make sure the side panel is open.*
    

### Add New Safe Account

Once a signer account is connected, link a Safe that the Pilot Signer will act on behalf of.

1. Add a descriptive label (e.g. “DAO Treasury” or “NFT Vault”).
2. Select a chain from the dropdown.
3. Paste a Safe address or select from the list.
4. Click **Create**. 

You have now added and labeled a Safe Account — an account to be acted on. Add more by clicking **+New Safe Account** from the left menu.

### Select Pilot Signer and Choose Route

You must now select the Pilot Signer to complete the route setup.

1. Back in the Pilot side panel, click **Complete route setup to submit** or edit the Safe Account from the Safe Account page.
2. In the Pilot Signer field, select an eligible signer (a.k.a. initiator) from the dropdown. This could be the signer wallet you used to initially connect to Pilot, but it also includes any address connected to the Safe via ownership, delegated roles, nested Safes, modules, or any combination.
3. Choose a route. Pilot surfaces all viable routes between accounts so you can select the most efficient path.
4. Click **Save**.

You have now created a route from the Pilot Signer to the Safe Account. The Pilot Signer can now build and signs transactions for the selected Safe Account in Pilot.

## 02 Build & Execute Transactions

### Record a Batch of Transactions

1. Open the Pilot side panel.
2. Navigate to a dapp (e.g. CoW Swap).
3. Connect your wallet and select “Pilot” (not WalletConnect, MetaMask, etc.) — this links the designated Safe Account directly to the dapp. (If "Pilot" doesn't show up in the list, make sure your extension is installed and active.)
4. Interact with the dapp as usual. Each transaction will be recorded automatically in the side panel, where you can also delete, copy txn data, and more.
    
    *Note: If you close the side panel before submitting the batch, your progress will be lost.*
    
5. To add more transactions, simply interact with other dapps. Each step is automatically recorded and simulated in a local sandbox via Tenderly as you go. Edit, delete, and modify transactions as needed.
6. When ready, click **Submit** at the bottom of the panel.

### Review and Sign Transaction Bundle

1. Once the batch of transactions are submitted through Pilot’s side panel, the companion app will open with the transaction information. 
    
    *Note: If you close the page or navigate away, your transaction batch won't be visible by default. Recover it using your browser history or the back button.*
    
2. Review all transaction details: token flows, approvals, permission checks, account info, and signer details.
3. Click **Sign** to confirm. This will prompt your Pilot Signer wallet to sign the transaction batch.

### Delegate with Roles (optional)

Want to delegate execution? Use [Zodiac Roles](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/) to set up permissioned access. 

With Roles, you can:

- Create and assign custom roles to any address
- Define granular permissions for functions, addresses, and values
- Set frequency and threshold limits for added security
- Manage roles programmatically using the SDK and subgraph

Learn more about Zodiac Roles [here](/documentation/roles-modifier).
